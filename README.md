It's a cross-platform currency converter that I named Currencia built with Google Flutter technology.

In the first version, it's a simple UI, designed with Figma, that converts over 200 currencies thanks to Open Rates API.

And then, there's V2, a much better and more beautiful user interface, with launch screen, linked to Yahoo Finance API.

I aim to upgrade it to a V3 where there's pretty Login and Singup with the backend using Google Firebase for Databases.

Moreover, I created the app's brand slogan, logo, wireframe, UML Use Case, MCD Diagram, Gantt Chart, Sequence Diagram and SRS Document.

You can find the video demo attached.
