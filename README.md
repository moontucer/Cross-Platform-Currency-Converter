    It's a cross-platform currency converter that I named Currencia built with Flutter technology.
    
    In the first version, it's a simple UI that converts over 200 currencies thanks to Open Rates API. 

    And then, there's V2, a much better and more beautiful user interface linked to Yahoo Finance API. 
    
    I aim to upgrade it to a V3 where there's some pretty Login and Singup with the backend using Firebase.
    
    Moreover, I created the brand's logo, its UML use case along with its MCD Diagram.
